# Warehouse-Management-System

My project is on maintaining and managing wholesale warehouse store system website with the database. It keeps track of all the information about stock details, Customers details, Buyers details. It also calculates three types of profit yearly, profit monthly, profit daily. Once the quantity of stock goes less than 10, it is designed to warn about refilling of the stock. It also keeps track of total sales, pending payments, paid payments, list of Customers whose payment is pending.
